# Arkanoid Game â€“ Java Project

This project is a recreation of the classic **Arkanoid** game, developed as part of a university course assignment in Java.

## ðŸŽ® Game Features

- Paddle controlled by keyboard input
- Ball movement with collision physics
- Bricks that disappear when hit
- Score tracking and life counter
- Multiple listeners for handling events (e.g. block removal, ball loss)
- Object-oriented design with clear separation of responsibilities

## ðŸ§± Architecture Overview

- `collisionDetection` â€“ Handles collision logic and game environment
- `geometryPrimitive` â€“ Classes for geometric shapes: `Point`, `Line`, `Rectangle`
- `hitListener` / `hitNotifier` â€“ Event system for reacting to hits
- `game` â€“ Core game loop and counters
- `Ass5Game.java` â€“ Entry point and game initialization

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Java
- OOP principles
- Event-driven architecture
- Simple physics and game loop

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the game:

1. Compile the project using your favorite Java IDE or the provided `build.xml` file.
2. Run the main class:
   ```
   Ass5Game.java
   ```

Make sure all source files are in the correct package structure as provided under `src/`.
